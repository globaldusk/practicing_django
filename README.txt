Welcome to my chatbot Django demonstration code

To view and use my chatbot follow these instructions:
1. open a terminal window and use the cd command to navigate to /A_Django_Project
2. run the following command to activate the Django server: python manage.py.runserver
3. then in a browser go to the url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

This is where you will see two different iframes running my chatbot differently
